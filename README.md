TODO:
  * either fix the randomizer in the rails app, or shuffle questions in app, you should only get 1 q per category every 50 questions
  * move view to scroll view
  * have the concept of players & a game, maybe swipe to different parts of the screen to add to different players scores
  * ADD TESTS!
  * format text nicely in Answers/categories. Questions look generally okay.
